Asset registry (`asset-registry`) project is being developed for users to register and query their assets. Some assets might include, physical land, argicultural machinery, water management systems, tractors, etc. Each asset is considered to be a polygon. 

## Prerequisites


<!--are these prerequisite accurate or will this library already be within the stack? If the library is a part of AgStack, how does the user access the library?
* You must have a user account for AgStack.

<!--If this prereq is required, what command should the user run to verify the installation?-->
* Verify that the S2 Geometry library is installed on your local environment. See [S2 Geometry Quick Start](https://s2geometry.io/devguide/cpp/quickstart).

<!--Should the user have python installed to use AgStack? Will Python already be within the stack? -->


## Search for an exisiting asset

You can search for specific assets by entering the geospatial information for your polygon. After you query your polygon, you receive a 256-byte/16-Char alphanumeric unique ID. You can view only the assets that are available from your user account.
